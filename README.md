## How to Use:

1. **Add the Action to Your Workflow**:  
   Include the `dep-scan-action` in your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file. Hereâ€™s an example:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      security-audit:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Run dep-scan-action
            uses: cob0/dep-scan-action@master
            with:
              src: 'path/to/your/source'
              profile: 'appsec'
              project_type: 'nodejs'
            env:
              VDB_HOME: ${{ github.workspace }}/db
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          - name: Upload report to build artifacts
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
            with:
              name: dep-scan-report
              path: path/to/report/directory/*
    ```

2. **Configure Inputs:**

   Specify the inputs as needed. You can customize the `src`, `profile`, and `project_type` based on your project
   requirements.
   If you do not provide a value for an input, the action will use the default value.

3. **Review the Results:**

   After the action runs, review the output logs to see the results of the security audit. The action will provide
   insights
   into any vulnerabilities found in your dependencies.

4. **Upload Reports:**

   The last step in the example uploads the generated reports as artifacts. Make sure to replace
   `path/to/report/directory/*` with the actual path where the reports are generated by the `dep-scan-action`.
